# Welcome To Return YouTube Dislikes contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! All your changes will be reflected in the next version of the extension (or the [website](https://www.returnyoutubedislike.com/)).

## Getting Started

Please use Prettier with default settings for formatting.

#### Prerequisites

You need to have node and npm installed to create the bundled version of the source.

Versions used when setting up:

- node: 12.18.4
- npm: 6.14.6

To create the `bundled-content-script.js` that contains most of the business logic of this extension you have to install all dependencies first.

1. Go to the root of the repo and run:

```
npm install
```

2. Run the following command to create `bundled-content-script.js` which is used in `manifest.json`

```
npm start // to create the build file(s) and start a file watcher that hot-reloads on save

// or

npm run build // to create the build file(s) once
```

Congratulations, You are now ready to develop!
